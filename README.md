## How to play the game
Start by running the code (best from intellij). 
Press enter to start the game. You can either press left or right arrow. 
To jump to the left or up on the left side you press left and to jump to the right side or up on the right side you press right. 
If you press wrong you lose.

There is also a debug mode that turns on if you press 'd'.
